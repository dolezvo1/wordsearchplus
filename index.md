# Word Search Plus

Word Search Plus is a [word search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search ) implementation with couple extra features.

* The boards can be randomly generated based on any appropriate JSON file (see the `extra/` directory for examples), both remote (by URL) and local.
* Definitions for every word
* Search by definitions or blind search, all with customizable probabilities
* Set specific word count, options to filter words by length.
