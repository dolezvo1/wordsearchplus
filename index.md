# Word Search Plus

Word Search Plus is a [word search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search ) implementation with couple extra features.

* Definitions for every word, search by definitions or blind search, all with customizable probabilities
* TODO: generate only boards where every searched word occurs exactly once.
* The boards can be randomly generated based on any appropriate JSON file (see the `extra/` directory for examples), both remote (by URL) and local.

Created as semestral project for the NI-AFP course ([syllabus in english]](https://bk.fit.cvut.cz/en/predmety/00/00/00/00/00/00/06/15/75/p6157506.html ), [syllabus in czech]](https://bk.fit.cvut.cz/cz/predmety/00/00/00/00/00/00/06/15/75/p6157506.html ) ).

Simplest way it to navigate to (TODO: location) in your browser.
